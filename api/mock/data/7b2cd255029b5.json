    "description": "* *+Objective+*\r\n We want to allow users to choose multiple location posting. Therefore, when a user selects L3 location, we can ask if they want to have this ad searchable under all L1 (Western Cape) or L2 (Cape Town) of that L3 e.g. a post in Century City (L3) will display under all Western Cape (L1) or Cape Town (L2). This aims to solve the SPAM problem in certain categories especially Services. We will make this a paid feature so users don't need to SPAM across locations covering their service area.\r\n\r\n*+implementation+*\r\n * \r\n ** This feature is available for Services at the beginning but with potential extend to other categories. Therefore, we will use the leaf category feature price at the beginning for feature pricing then when user select multiple location posting feature, we will dynamic load the new pricing at L1 or L2 according to price list. \r\n ** The feature is configurable by price list info as we do for other feature. If we have a price number on multiple location posting feature for a specific node, FE will make this option available for user. Therefore, we can have more flexibility to manage this feature when we roll out for testing. \r\n ** It will be one ad showing L1 or L2 location on My Ad, SRP and VIP.\r\n ** All view count, reply and other engagement data will be under this single ad ID.\r\n ** For users, this is one ad they can manage their business across various locations.\r\n ** Other features on this ad will also apply across locations.\r\n ** When user select L1 or L2, get feature BAPI will fetch feature pricing at L1 or L2 level for FE dynamically update the pricing.\r\n ** This will apply to Post/ Edit/ Draft BAPI. \r\n *+Mock-up+*\r\n\r\nMVP: [https://ebayclassifiedsgroup.invisionapp.com/share/BZMZSA4MYEF#/309068960_PAF_ZA_3-0_-_All_Features_Bottom_Full]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDesktop:\r\n\r\n*L1 only:* zpl.io/beY3zRN \r\n\r\n ** *L1+L2*: zpl.io/blp3rYD\r\n\r\n*List of locations included pop-up:* zpl.io/VOk6Wkj\r\n\r\n*Extended location example:* zpl.io/aMqoLwJ\r\n\r\n*edit ad changing location* *Pop-up warning:* zpl.io/aB5zwLA\r\n\r\n*VIP with extended location:* zpl.io/aRY4ml0\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMobile:\r\n\r\n*L1 only:* zpl.io/2ym31ML  \r\n\r\n ** *L1+L2*: zpl.io/29ZmN3e\r\n\r\n*List of locations included pop-up:* zpl.io/bLO9L3Y\r\n\r\n*Extended location example:* ** zpl.io/2j43pOW\r\n\r\n*edit ad changing location* ** *Pop-up warning:* zpl.io/2pO30W8**\r\n\r\n*VIP with extended location:* zpl.io/bAqROPo**",
